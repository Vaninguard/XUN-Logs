# Imagine's illegitimate UN group
These are the unfiltered chat logs from the false UN Group "XUN | United Nations".
These people support hood organisations (or rather, terrorist organisations) in the name of "roleplay" and had banned the owner of Vaninguard over opposing their ideas. 

We will not be naming those involved in this terrorist organisation as we do not advocate for harassment of those involved. The logs are uploaded as a form of transparency.
