As a representative of Vaninguard, I want to provide you information on Vaninguard's future.

The official reasoning behind banning the owner of Vaninguard was because he had said the N-word. A previous member called "George"  was banned for saying a slur (not the N-word). The owner of Vaninguard wanted to challenge the ban, so he said the hard-R in protest.

The owners claimed someone had made a report about it, however they refused to be open and transparent about the report. I am not convinced that they simply found out what the owner of Vaninguard did a week ago today.

It is clear that there were clear policy differences between the owners of the UN group and the owner of Vaninguard in regards to criminal (or rather hood) organisations. This is why the owner of Vaninguard was banned.

The owner of Vaninguard opposed banning someone purely over a the use of a "slur". He was punished for going against the ideas of the owners of this UN group. 

The same goes in regards to hood organisations. Because of the owner of Vaninguard said in #international-feed, Vaninguard was suppressed. He had accused UN owners of supporting criminal organisations. This is the price that Vaninguard paid for combatting terrorism.

Vaninguard will be departing from the UN. We are sure the owners will be proud of this.

We would like to thank other nations for our time here. 

In return for our time here, we have uploaded XUN's entire chat log to GitHub. For those who do not know what it is, it is a website often used by developers for hosting code. Our user account is Vaninguard, from there on you can find our repository showing XUN's chat logs (or simply go to https://github.com/Vaninguard/XUN-Logs).

We want to advocate for full transparency in regards to actions taken here. We believe that there is a good chance the server will be purged to hide the heinous acts that were conducted by terrorists here. This is left as a reference for all nations in the UN group to beware of.
